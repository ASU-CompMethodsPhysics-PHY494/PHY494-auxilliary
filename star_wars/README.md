# Data Files for Lesson 01 #

Data on the Star Wars (tm) universe are obtained from
[SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) using their Python interface
[swapi-python](https://github.com/phalt/swapi-python).

Install `swapi` from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/swapi):

	pip install --user swapi
	
Then pull down data, reformat, and write out as shown in the notebook
`sw_data.ipynb`. (Note: this is a very quick and dirty hack...)
